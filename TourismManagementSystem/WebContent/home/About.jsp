	Tourism is travel for pleasure; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating,
	and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be international, or within the 
	traveller's country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the
	common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in 
	places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other
	purposes".
	</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
	Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on
	a country's balance of payments. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the 
	economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.
